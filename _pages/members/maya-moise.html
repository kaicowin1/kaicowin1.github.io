    <p style="font-size: large;">
        <b>External President</b><br>
        <i>Junior Dual Degree Candidate in Sports Medicine and Sports Law</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Maya Moise is a junior at Rice University, majoring in Exercise Physiology/Sports Medicine, 
        and Sports Management with a concentration in Sports Law. A decorated scholar-athlete and 
        recipient of the Miami Herald Silver Knight Award for Athletics, she has been dedicated to 
        athlete advocacy since high school, founding the Patriot Sports Medicine Club at American 
        Heritage.
        <br><br>
        At Rice, Maya’s passion for sports law grew as she recognized the need for strong athlete 
        representation in contracts, NIL deals, and compliance. She has researched the House v. NCAA 
        settlement, arguing its revenue-sharing cap is an antitrust violation, and introduced Tulane’s 
        International Baseball Arbitration Competition to Rice. Now serving as a TA for Advanced Sports 
        Law, she actively expands undergraduate involvement in the field.
        <br><br>
        An Olympic weightlifter ranked second in the nation, Maya also competes in powerlifting with a 
        goal of competing for University Worlds. With firsthand NIL experience and a social media 
        following of 40,000+, she understands the business side of athlete representation and is committed 
        to ensuring athletes are protected both legally and personally. Whether as an attorney, agent, or 
        in-house counsel, Maya is dedicated to safeguarding athletes’ careers and futures.
